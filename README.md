# WhatTheFoodBot


YOU MUST CREATE 2 DIRECTORIES IN THE FOLDER YOU STORE THE PYTHON FILE. 

1 DIRECTORY MUST BE NAMED EXACTLY "google_search" AND THE OTHER MUST BE CALLED EXACTLY "place_details" 


A simple Discord bot that was made with the intention of helping me and my friends decide what to get to eat. The bot will store idea inputs from admin users and spit out a random idea from the list you and your friends create. You can remove from the list as well as print the entire list out for everyone to see.
